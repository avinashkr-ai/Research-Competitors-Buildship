This project, titled "Research-Competitors-Buildship," provides a React-based application designed for managing and exporting buildship workflows. It utilizes various technologies, including React, Angular, Kubernetes, and Express.js, to facilitate the creation and execution of these workflows.

## üìã SUMMARY

This project is designed to manage and export buildship workflows, leveraging React for the user interface and potentially integrating with Angular, Kubernetes, and Express.js for backend and orchestration. The core capabilities involve handling different file types, executing tools, and managing storage. It aims to provide a structured way to define and execute complex workflows. The target audience includes developers and researchers needing to automate and manage build processes.

**Key technologies used:** React, Angular, Kubernetes, Express.js.

## üìù DESCRIPTION

## üöÄ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- TypeScript

**Installation:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/avinashkr-ai/Research-Competitors-Buildship.git
cd Research-Competitors-Buildship

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

**Configuration:**

Environment Variables:

The project utilizes several environment variables, potentially configured via a `.env` file.  These include:

- `BS_ENV` (multiple occurrences)
- `key`
- `nodeId`
- `runtimeEnv`
- `BUILDSHIP_API_KEY`
- `BUCKET`

And approximately 24 more environment variables -  examine the codebase for specific usage and configuration instructions.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the necessary values.  For example:

```text
BS_ENV=development
BUILDSHIP_API_KEY=your_api_key
BUCKET=your_bucket_name
```

**Available Scripts:**

- `build`: `tsc` (Compiles the TypeScript code)
- `mcp`: `node dist/mcp.js` (Runs the mcp.js file)
- `dev`: `ts-node index.ts` (Runs the index.ts file using ts-node)
- `test`: `echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1` (Placeholder for tests)

## üìñ USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
```

2.  **Run the application in development mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
```

3.  **Run the `mcp.ts` file:**

    ```bash
    npm run mcp
```

The exact usage will depend on the specific implementation of the buildship workflows. Refer to the source code and the intended functionality for more detailed instructions. No API routes detected, so the application is likely CLI based.

## üîê AUTHENTICATION

The presence of `BUILDSHIP_API_KEY` environment variable suggests that authentication is used within the application. The specifics of the authentication method are not fully detailed in the extracted files, but the API key is likely used to authenticate requests to external services.

## üìö API DOCUMENTATION

No API routes detected. The provided files appear to focus on internal workflow processing and file handling rather than providing external API endpoints.

## üåç DEPLOYMENT

Deployment will depend on the specific hosting requirements.  Given the usage of React, Angular, Kubernetes and Express.js, options include:

- **Cloud Platforms:** Deploying to cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure.
- **Containerization:** Utilizing Docker to containerize the application and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Serverless:** Deploying the application as serverless functions.

Ensure that all necessary environment variables are configured in the production environment.
